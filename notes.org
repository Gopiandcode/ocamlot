* General Knowledge
** Setting up postgres
#+begin_src sh
  docker run --name postgres \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
    -d postgres
#+end_src
** Setting up pgadmin via docker
#+begin_src sh
  docker run -i -t --rm \
                 -p 80:80 \ # map HOST:CONTAINER ports
                 -e 'PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=user@localhost.com' \
                 -e 'PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=password'
                 -v  \
                 -d dpage/pgadmin4

** Communicating between containers
- By default, containers are hooked into the bridge docker subnetwork.
- Running the following command will list out the containers connected to bridge
  #+begin_src sh
    docker network inspect bridge    
  #+end_src
- Containers can then access each other by using the IP address assigned to them in the docker subnetwork
- This is useful for connecting from pgadmin to a postgres
* Hiccups
** Followers/Following should be returned by actor endpoint
** Everything should have an id, else things will break
** Accept headers should be specified when looking up elements, else things will fail
* Overview
consists of two layers:
 - server to server federation
 - client to server protocol

representation of users, with properties:
  - inbox :: messages from the world
  - outbox :: send messages out

these endpoints are listed in the activitystreams description:

- example usecase:
    - alyssa's client posts a message to her outbox on her server
       - NOTE: as a message is not an activity, her server wraps it in a create object
    - server looks up ben's activitystreams actor and posts object to inbox
    - ....
    - alysa's client gets her inbox, and recieves ben's message (has also been wrapped in create)
- another usecase:
    - alyssa wants to like ben's post
    - alyssa's client posts to outbox {type: like, to=["ben"]; actor: alyssa; object: "id of ben's post"}
       - NOTE: as a like is an activity, no need to wrap in create
- to send a public/followers message, include followers & public
* Parts I need to implement
** Inbox
*** GET - returns messages from user
*** POST - adds a message to user 
** Outbox
*** GET - returns outbound messages for user
*** POST - adds outbound message for user

*** Core
**** Activity pub
***** _meta 
***** save (box, activity)
- saves an activity to a box
- logic is:
  - retrieve meta information (lookup what _meta does)
  - if into outbox and is follow, then set follow status of meta information to waiting
  - else if create activity,
     - get object being created
     - retrieve mentions and hashtags
     - append to metadata
  - insert into box, raw activity, type, id, and meta information
***** outbox is blocked
- looks up in db if there exists a entry
  - in outbox
  - with block status
  - id being the selected id
  - and in metadata, has not been undone
***** activity url
- returns the BASE_URL plus, url_for (outbox_detail, id = item_id)
***** post to inbox (activity)
- logic is:
  - get actor for activity
  - if activity with remote_id matching activity in inbox, ignore
  - else
    - save activity to inbox
    - if not a delete or update activity
        - queue task to update cached actor
    - queue task to process activity
    - queue task to finish post to inbox
****** impl-specific logic  
- the following logic is run before any of the generic processing
  - if outbox is blocked, return without doing anything
  - else if
      - actor is an application type
      - actor id ends with /relay 
      - activity type is announce
      - and there are no creation activities with the same id
      - and no replies from the remote id of object id of activity
    - then queue a process reply of object id
  - else if 
      - update activity
      - id is object_id
    - then queue task to update cached actor
***** save reply (activity, meta)
 - get visibility of activity
 - get published date of activity (or now if not present)
 - insert activity into replies
   #+BEGIN_SRC json
{ "activity": "<json>", "type": activity.type, "remote_id": activity.id, 
  "meta": {
     "undo": false, "deleted": false, "public": is_public, 
     "server": urlparse(id).hostname, "visibility", "actor_id": activity.get_actor().id
     "published"
  }
}   
   #+END_SRC
***** post to outbox (activity)
- if activity is create type, wrap activity in create type
- obj_id = assign create a random id
- create uri for obj id 
- if create activity, 
    - activity._data.object.id = base_url + url_for outbox + obj_id
    - if no url field in data for object, then assign object url:
      base_url + url_for note_by_id + obj_id    
    - reset object cache for activity
- save object to outbox
- queue task to update the cached actor
- queue task to finish posting to outbox activity
***** accept follow (activity)
- retrieve id for actor
- create accept object, with type follow, id being activity.id, actor being actor_id, send to actor, published now
- update one_activity by the remote id and set accepted status to true
- post activity to outbox accepted
***** handle question reply (create, question)
- retrieve choice from create.get_object().name
- if  choice not in c["name"] for c in question.data.get("oneOf", question.any_of)
   - ignore
- else
   - retrieve answer key
    - if duplicate vote then ignore
    - else
       - update create object with question.id, 
           - increment question replies
           - increment question_answers.answer_key by 1
      - also update remote id of create
         - poll_answer to question.id
         - answer choice to choice
         - stream to false?
         - poll_answer to true
***** handle replies (create)
 - retrieve in reply to of create object
 - if not found, ignore
 - retrieve remote activity in reply to
 - get reply from remote create object  (ensure is create)
 - if local reply to local question
       - i.e, starts with base url
       - is a question type
       - create is local reply
       - and create is not public
   - then handle question reply locally
   - else if private vote to remote question
     - set sent to true to reply .id in inbox 
**** inbox
**** outbox
**** notifications
**** tasks
**** meta
***** notes
- tracks object id & separate remote_id in metadata
- box field represents inbox or outbox
